# Multiplicative Decrease Scaling

Multiplicative Decrease Scaling (MDS or MD-Scaling) provides high-fidelity
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a way that's compatible with
conventional congestion control algorithms (CCAs) in a single queue.

Please see the [writeup](MD-Scaling.md) for details and test results.
